This is a basic installation guide for PyShellOS.

1. download the PyShelOS directory (if you read this then you've already managed to do so)
2. open the /PyShellOS/ directory in your terminal.
3. execute "py main.py" to run the operating system.
4. On first boot you'll notice it takes a long time. On reboot it'll be quicker.
5. If you have ay questions, either run "help" in the os or dm me on discord (.stefanmarston)
